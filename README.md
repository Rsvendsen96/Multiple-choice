# Multiple-choice
I'm trying to make a multiple choice, with amdin, users and login.
The end result i'm looking for is that you have an admin which can create users, create tests with multiple choice or text answers. 
The created users can log in, and complete the test the admin has created and will get a pass or not passed at the end when they deliver the test.
